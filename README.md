# LSTM-and-GRU-for-Short-Term-Stock-Forecasting

### Description:

The stock market is a complex and volatile field, requiring accurate prediction tools to optimize profits and minimize risks. Machine learning applications, particularly LSTM and GRU, have the capability to process large datasets and recognize complex patterns, enhancing the accuracy of short-term stock price predictions. These models also improve accuracy in making investment decisions based on historical data, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors like exchange rates.

***Output:***
Both models demonstrated strong forecasting abilities when applied to key features. The results showed that GRU is more stable when using different data windows, with GRU's RMSE at 999.62 and LSTM's at 1287.24. The lowest MAPE reached 1.08%, proving the high accuracy of the models in predicting short-term stock prices.
